# BlueSource
BlueSource is a dual switching power supply based on the ISL6236A Chip

The circuit will give two set of outputs 5V and 3.3V . For further controlling the output adjust the values of the resistors (R14,R15,R20) for the OUTPUT1 and (R11,R12,R13,R19) for OUTPUT2 . The values can be found out by using the equation given at the IC datasheet.
